Cryptography Algorithms Implementation
This repository contains implementations of various cryptography algorithms in Python, C, and C++.

Overview:
This repository provides implementations of cryptographic algorithms in Python, C, and C++. Each algorithm is implemented in its respective language for educational purposes and to demonstrate how these algorithms work.

Algorithms Implemented:

1)Generating Big Primes
Implemented in Python, this script generates large prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

2)Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
Implemented in C, this program demonstrates the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm for secure key exchange between two parties.

3)RSA Encryption
Implemented in C++, this program showcases the RSA encryption algorithm for secure data transmission and encryption.


Python Code (Generating Big Primes)
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Usage
1)Navigate to the python directory.
2)Run the script:
python generate_big_primes.py
3)Follow the prompts to generate large prime numbers.

C++ Code (RSA Encryption)
Prerequisites
C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
OpenSSL library (for handling large integers, if necessary)

Usage
1)Navigate to the cpp directory.
2)Compile the code:
g++ RSA.cpp -o RSA
3)Run the executable:
./RSA
4)Follow the prompts to perform RSA encryption and decryption.

C Code (Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange)
Prerequisites
C compiler (e.g., GCC)

Usage
1)Navigate to the c directory.
2)Compile the code:
gcc diffie_hellman.c -o diffie_hellman
3)Run the executable:
./diffie_hellman
4)Follow the prompts to perform the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
